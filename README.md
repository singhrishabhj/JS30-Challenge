# JS30-Challenge
"This repo contains my projects from the [JavaScript 30 Days Challenge](https://javascript30.com) by @wesbos. Each day, I build a new project using vanilla JS, focusing on DOM manipulation, event handling, and more. Follow my journey as I enhance my JS skills without libraries or frameworks! #javascript30
